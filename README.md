# goonpug-notifier
Application that runs in the system tray and alerts you when players are needed for sub.io games.

Checks every 30 seconds to get player counts and alerts if there are between 5 and 10 players (alerts will happen every 10 minutes at most).

Right click the tray icon to see the servers and click one to join. It will join with +connect to avoid the server browser fps lag.
